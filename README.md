Default Theme
===

When you install hakyll, the default theme works with this directory structure: 

```sh
   |-css
   |-images
   |-posts
   |-templates
```


The templates have this structure by default:

```sh
  |-templates/
    |---archive.html
    |---default.html
    |---post-list.html
    |---post.html
```


The newly added css files are in the /css/ folder.


To preview, run `./site preview` from this directory and go to http://localhost:8000 in your browser
